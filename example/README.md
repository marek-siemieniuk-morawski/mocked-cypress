# `mocked-cypress` example

A simple Cypress project to show how to use `mocked-cypress` in practice and organise mocks.

Don't bother yourself with running it - it doesn't work. We don't visit the actual page so any request cannot be intercepted.

Probably you want to check two places:

- `cypress/mocks`
- `cypress/e2e/example.cy.ts`

to learn how exactly to use the library.
